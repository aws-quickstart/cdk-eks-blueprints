# New Relic Addon - AWS EKS Blueprints for CDK

This repository contains the source code for the New Relic AddOn for AWS EKS Blueprints. EKS Blueprints is a [CDK](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/) construct that makes it easy for customers to configure and deploy New Relic's Kubernetes integration as part of an EKS Blueprint cluster on [Amazon EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/).

## Installation

Using [npm](https://npmjs.org):

```bash
npm install @newrelic/newrelic-eks-blueprints-addon
```

For a quick tutorial on EKS Blueprints, visit the [Getting Started guide](https://aws-quickstart.github.io/cdk-eks-blueprints/getting-started/).

## Usage

```
import * as cdk from 'aws-cdk-lib';
import * as blueprints from '@aws-quickstart/eks-blueprints';
import { NewRelicAddOn } from '@newrelic/newrelic-eks-blueprints-addon';

const app = new cdk.App();

blueprints.EksBlueprint.builder()
    .addOns(new blueprints.MetricsServerAddOn)
    .addOns(new blueprints.ClusterAutoScalerAddOn)
    .addOns(new blueprints.addons.SSMAgentAddOn)
    .addOns(new blueprints.addons.SecretsStoreAddOn)
    .addOns(new NewRelicAddOn({
        version: "4.2.0-beta",
        newRelicClusterName: "demo-cluster",
        awsSecretName: "newrelic-pixie-combined", // Secret Name in AWS Secrets Manager
        installPixie: true,
        installPixieIntegration: true,
    }))
    .region(process.env.AWS_REGION)
    .account(process.env.AWS_ACCOUNT)
    .build(app, 'demo-cluster');
```

## Validation


### NRQL Query
---

Almost immediately after the New Relic pods enter a `Running` state in the cluster, data should be reported to New Relic.  You can validate that metrics are making it to New Relic with the following NRQL query:

```FROM K8sClusterSample, K8sNodeSample select latest(clusterK8sVersion), latest(agentVersion) as 'NR Agent Ver.', uniqueCount(nodeName) as 'Node Count' facet clusterName limit max```
