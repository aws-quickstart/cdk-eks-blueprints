# New Relic AddOn for AWS EKS SSP

This repository contains the source code for the New Relic AddOn for AWS EKS Shared Services Platform (SSP). `ssp-amazon-eks` is a [CDK](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/) construct that makes it easy for customers to build and deploy New Relic's Kubernetes Integration as part of a Shared Services Platform (SSP) on top of [Amazon EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/).

## Installation

Using [npm](https://npmjs.org):

```bash
$ npm install @newrelic/newrelic-ssp-addon
```

## Usage

```
import { App } from '@aws-cdk/core';
import * as ssp from '@aws-quickstart/ssp-amazon-eks';
import { NewRelicAddOn } from '@newrelic/newrelic-ssp-addon';

const app = new App();

ssp.EksBlueprint.builder()
    .addOns(new ssp.MetricsServerAddOn)
    .addOns(new ssp.ClusterAutoScalerAddOn)
    .addOns(new ssp.addons.SSMAgentAddOn)
    .addOns(new ssp.addons.SecretsStoreAddOn)
    .addOns(new NewRelicAddOn({
        nrLicenseKeySecretName: "newrelic-license-key", // Secret Name in AWS Secrets Manager
        newRelicClusterName: "demo-cluster"
    }))
    .region(process.env.AWS_REGION)
    .account(process.env.AWS_ACCOUNT)
    .build(app, 'demo-cluster');
```
