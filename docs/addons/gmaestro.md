# gMaestro add-on for Amazon EKS Blueprints

This repository contains the source code for the gMaestro add-on for [Amazon EKS Blueprints](https://aws-quickstart.github.io/cdk-eks-blueprints/). This add-on is a [CDK](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/) construct that allows customers to add gMaestro to their Amazon EKS clusters.

gMaestro is a Kubernetes cost optimization solution that helps companies reduce spending on unutilized resources by up to 60%.
With gMaestro, you gain full visibility into K8s clusters, seamlessly interact with HPA scaling policies, and achieve your cost-performance goals by applying custom rightsizing recommendations based on actual usage in production.
1. **Install gMaestro** - As a single pod on your cluster with a single command line.
2. **Multi-cluster visibility** - Gain visibility into each controller, resource request, container, HPA policy, utilization, and cost.
3. **Apply custom recommendations** - gMaestro generates custom recommendations by analyzing the actual utilization of each controller.

For additional information, visit [gMaestro documentation](https://gmaestro.gitbook.io/gmaestro-docs/).

## Prerequisite 
Before using gMaestro, you need to:
1. [Sign up](https://app.granulate.io/gMaestroSignup) to the gMaestro platform
2. Download a sample YAML file - After signing up to gMaestro, navigate to the [Deploy](https://app.granulate.io/deploy) on the left-hand menu, fill in the required fields and click on "Generate Config File"

3. Create a secret (as a plaintext) in AWS Secrets Manager copy its value from the following place:
   1. Deployment section `MAESTRO_CLIENT_ID`

## Installation

Using [npm](https://npmjs.org):

```bash
$ npm i @granulate/gmaestro-eks-blueprints-addon
```

## Usage

```typescript
import 'source-map-support/register';
import * as CDK from 'aws-cdk-lib';
import * as blueprints from '@aws-quickstart/eks-blueprints';
import {GmaestroAddOn} from '@granulate/gmaestro-eks-blueprints-addon';

const app = new cdk.App();

const addOn = new GmaestroAddOn({
        clientIdSecretName: "<client id secret name>", // Create and copy from gMaestro deployment yaml
        clusterName: "<cluster name>",
        namespace: "<namespace>"
    });

const blueprint = blueprints.EksBlueprint.builder()
  .addOns(addOn)
  .build(app, 'my-stack-name');
```

Use the following command to validate that gMaestro installed successfully:

```bash
$ kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep granulate-maestro

NAMESPACE     NAME                                 READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
default       granulate-maestro-6947dc87bc-k5nfc   2/2     Running   0          11m
kube-system   aws-node-9rhgx                       1/1     Running   0          16m
kube-system   coredns-d5b9bfc4-8v8k5               1/1     Running   0          21m
kube-system   coredns-d5b9bfc4-r5sdb               1/1     Running   0          21m
kube-system   kube-proxy-js5pn                     1/1     Running   0          16m
```

After a few seconds, you will gain full visibility into your K8s cluster objects.
The first rightsizing recommendations may take up to 5 minutes to load.

## `gMaestroAddOn` Required (props)
Take the following parameter from the sample YAML file that was downloaded.

#### `clientIdSecretName: string`

The secret name from the Prerequisite section 3.i.

#### `clusterName: string`

Copy from the Deployment section `MAESTRO_SERVICE_NAME` value

#### `namespace: string` (optional)

The namespace where gMaestro will be installed. `default` namespace is used as default.


## Security issue

1. The implementation requires access to the AWS Secrets Manager at build time to retrieve secret values.
2. The secret value will be stored as plain text in the resulting CloudFormation stack, meaning that any user with access to view CloudFormation stack can gain access to this secret.

Note: This secret is specific to gMaestro and don't affect customer account beyond the scope of the gMaestro add-on.

This issue will be mitigated and updated in the following weeks.
