# According to the compose spec we can specify the compose project name here. However, VS Code does
# not honor this as of 21 Apr 2023. Therefore there is a .env file at the root of this git repository
# in which the environment variable COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME is defined as 'rimutec'. Once VS Code supports
# the top-level element 'name', the following can be used instead.
name: 'rimutec'

         # Change the port number in case you have more than one dev container based on this
         # template. For example, you could use something like:

         # [Manfred, 29jul2022]
         - "3000:3000" # <<<<<< if preferred, explicit forward the port used by express
         # Using double quotes for port mapping to avoid YAML reading it as a number with a different base
         # e.g. "3333:22" would result in port numbers greater than 130000 which are clearly invalid.
         # Without double quotes YAML interprets it as a number based on 22. [Manfred, 24aug2022]
